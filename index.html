								  <p>By Pranavi Kompally</p>
								<p>Within the past few years, interest in all aspects of our environment has increased in proportion to the damage we are doing to it. Birds form not only an attractive but an essential part of the environment. Yet the protection afforded to them is patchy, at best. Taking Europe as an example and France in particular, there is a custom in that country to shoot as many as possible of the small song-birds as they return north from their migration to Africa. They are considered a delicacy.</p><br>
								<p>Of course the shooting of birds in Britain for sport as well as for food has been a tradition for centuries, but the shooting is restricted to game birds, grouse, pheasants, partridges and wild duck. Except for the wild duck, these species are hand-reared and fed by gamekeepers, the numbers shot are limited, and the shooting-season, which begins on 12th August, ends well before the breeding season begins. Thus, the game species are well preserved. </p><br>
								<p>For many years steps have been taken to maintain, if not increase numbers of all types of birds. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds keeps a careful watch on preservation, and has instigated laws against the theft of eggs, which are rigorously implemented. Many sanctuaries for water-birds as well as songbirds have been established up and down the length of Britain. The public in general has been educated to place a high value on the bird-life of their country. </p><br>
								<p>Yet for reasons other than shooting and theft, various species seem to dwindle away to the point of extinction, causing widespread concern. For many decades, habitats have been systematically destroyed by the clearance of woods and hedges to provide the large fields needed for modern agriculture. Secondly, certain chemicals used to keep crops free from pests also destroyed the food on which many birds survived. Today, the problem is realized, and attention is given both to habitat and food, with the result that many species have been saved. Some chemicals, which also poisoned the birds themselves, have been banned. Wide strips between fields are left in their natural state to provide cover and nesting facilities. Many woods and coppices have been replanted with the traditional varieties of trees instead of the cash-crop conifers. Sea and marsh birds have been encouraged to return by exerting some control over land reclamation. In many countries, the protection of birds is being given a high priority. </p><br>
								<p>Birds are appreciated for their beauty and their song. However, neither faculty exists merely to please the human race. The colored plumage of many male birds has the function of impressing females prior to the mating season. Birdsong may have the same purpose at that time, though some of it seems to be simply the expression of joie de vivre and perhaps a means of staking out territory. The writer visited Belsen concentration camp shortly after its liberation. There was an eerie silence about the place. During and for some time after the holocaust, no bird came near the camp. So there may indeed be an emotional as well as a practical aspect to birdsong. Another practical function is to warn against predators and if possible scare them off. </p><br>
								<p>Birds play an essential part in the cycle of nature. They may and do raid crops, but they also eat grubs and insects which do far more damage. They also have a role as scavengers; that work is completed by the insects, which in turn fall prey to the birds. </p><br>
								<p>A few species, the ratital, have become flightless through natural selection. These are the emu, the ostrich, the rhea, the kiwi and the cassowary. The vast majority, the carinatal, are wonderfully adapted to flight, some being capable of spending most of their two to three-year lifespan on the wing. The muscular power of their wings relative to body-weight, and the aerodynamic efficiency of their wingspans and feather distribution, developed over millions of years, is one of nature's marvels. That is why the loss of so many land-birds through insensitive agricultural development, and of sea-birds through oil-spills, is such a tragedy. </p><br>
								<p>Another class of birds under threat and forming an essential part of the natural cycle is the predator; owls, hawks, eagles etc. These control small rodent pests and act as scavengers. Some also provide the sport of falconry, being to some extent amenable to human control. </p><br>
								<p>Perhaps the most wonderful feature of the bird is its ability to navigate so accurately in migrating. Its high body temperature and stamina can be built up to sustain amazingly long journeys, but the way in which the Arctic tern, for example, can fly direct from pole to pole, selecting just one small island stop en route, is not fully understood. Theories are manifold, but since fledglings with no experience perform this miracle, much still remains to be learnt.</p>

								<p>By Pranavi Kompally</p>
								<p>We all would have had some situations in our lives when we had been overly anxious. If we recall what actually happened, no doubt we would realize that at the time of the incident, we were not in control of ourselves. It would also probably be true that if we had kept cool instead of being anxious, we would have dealt with the situation in a better manner. There are some memories we have of people, perhaps of ourselves, who fared badly in a game or in a race because he was not cool. How about the footballer who missed the goal because he was anxious rather than cool, or the badminton player who lost because he was not cool or the man who failed his driving test because he was not cool ? These are common occurrences. The more serious ones are like when a person fails to get a job because he is not cool during an interview.</p><br>
								<p><b>According to experts, a person is anxious because he is afraid that he might fail. Then he fails because he is anxious. </b></p><br>
							   <p>This is a vicious circle. The solution seems to be that <b>a person has a better chance of succeeding in anything if he is confident of success;</b> since that confidence would keep him cool. To get to the bottom of this, it is necessary to see why a person is afraid to fail. The obvious answer seems to be that he has failed before in the same or in a similar situation and is afraid that it would happen again. The solution seems to be obvious: <b>To cure the spell of anxiety, the person should not think of the times he failed but of the times he succeeded.</b> This may not be as easy as it sounds.</p><br>
							<p>The fact is that a person is anxious by habit and what needs curing is the habit itself. <b> An excellent and practical technique has been suggested by some experts. In order to keep cool, a typically anxious person should list down all the failures (or lack of successes) in his life.</b> For each of these he should find an area of success - preferably greater than the area of failure. For example. the footballer who is anxious whenever he is taking a penalty kick (probably because he had missed on other occasions), should think of the times when he had scored a really difficult goal. What happens is that he programs his mind to think of the successes he has had whenever the thought of failure comes to his mind. He uses the negative to trigger the positive. If he does this several times on his own, he will develop a positive attitude. As soon as he develops that, he is coolness itself. One question arises immediately : What if a person has never known success in the area he wants to ? <b>The experts say that this is easily resolved.</b> The same result can be achieved by just pretending the good experiences. It seems that the mind cannot tell the difference between a real experience and an imagined one. In other words, you will benefit by imagining good things happening to you. </p><br>
							<p><b> Constant practice is necessary in order to keep cool.</b> After continual practice - perhaps for a few months - a person becomes cool. <b>It is assured by practitioners that keeping cool will give us a richer and better life.</b></p>
